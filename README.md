# Color Shades
Color Shades is a color generator.
Starting from a main color, new shades are generated based on the main hue.
- You can add new colors using the color picker, or you have the option to upload a JSON file that you downloaded before or someone shared with you.
- You can also upload a plain text file where each line contains the hex value of a color.
- Once you are happy with your color palette, you can download it as a JSON file.
